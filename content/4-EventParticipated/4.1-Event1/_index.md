### **Building a Unified Data Foundation on AWS – Kien Nguyen**

#### **Key Challenges**

- 89% of CDOs have initiated GenAI adoption, but only 52% believe their data foundation is ready.  
- Data, people, and operational silos are the primary barriers.

#### **Three layers of an End-to-End Data Architecture**

- **Producers**  
- **Foundations**  
- **Consumers**

#### **Critical AWS Data Components**

- **Amazon Bedrock**  
- **Databases** – RDS and vector-capable databases  
- **Analytics & ML** – SageMaker, Unified Studio  
- **Data Governance**  
- **Lake House** – S3, Redshift Managed Storage, Iceberg  
- **Amazon DataZone**

### **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) – Binh Tran**

#### **Two Development Patterns Today**

- **AI Managed Pattern** – Minimal supervision; reliability depends heavily on the model  
- **AI Assisted Pattern** – AI supports individual tasks rather than whole workflows

#### **Three AI-DLC Stages**

1. **Inception** – Context building, user stories, planning work units  
2. **Construction** – Coding, testing, architectural refinement, IaC + validation  
3. **Operation** – Production deployment via IaC and incident handling
