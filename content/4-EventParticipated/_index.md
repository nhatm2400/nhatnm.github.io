During my internship, I participated in four events—each offering valuable knowledge, memorable experiences, and exciting gifts and moments.

### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders  

&emsp;**Time:** Thursday, September 18, 2025, 9:00 – 17:00  

&emsp;**Location:** Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Event Summary:**  
Vietnam Cloud Day 2025 provided a comprehensive view of AWS’s GenAI strategy in Vietnam, opening with a keynote that emphasized Agentic AI and a unified data foundation as the backbone for large-scale AI applications. Insights from Techcombank, U2U Network, and the “GenAI Revolution” panel highlighted how enterprises are adopting GenAI for operations, system modernization, and risk governance aligned with Responsible AI principles. The technical track focused on Migration & Modernization, VMware-to-AWS transformation, and an Amazon Q Developer demo showcasing SDLC automation. Key topics such as Bedrock, Nova, AgentCore, AI-DLC, and the Lake House data ecosystem helped shape an end-to-end perspective for building and operating GenAI systems on AWS.


### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** AI/ML/GenAI Workshop on AWS  

&emsp;**Time:** Saturday, November 15, 2025, 8:30 – 12:00  

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Event Summary:**  
The event focused on the overall landscape of AI/ML and Generative AI on AWS, introducing service layers ranging from AI Services to Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. The session highlighted foundation models (Claude, Llama, Titan), prompt engineering techniques, along with RAG and Bedrock Agents for enterprise Q&A systems. The accompanying workshop guided participants through SageMaker for traditional ML and Bedrock for GenAI, illustrating the differences between the two approaches and how combining Bedrock + embeddings + RAG reduces hallucinations while maximizing value from enterprise data.


### [Event 3](4.3-Event3/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** DevOps Workshop on AWS  

&emsp;**Time:** Monday, November 17, 2025, 8:30 – 17:00  

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Event Summary:**  
The DevOps on AWS workshop delivered a systematic overview of DevOps principles and the AWS operational toolchain, covering CI/CD with CodeCommit–CodeBuild–CodeDeploy–CodePipeline, IaC with CloudFormation and CDK, container services (ECR, ECS, EKS, App Runner), and monitoring/observability via CloudWatch and X-Ray. The workshop explored automated build–test–deploy workflows, infrastructure-as-code design, and real-world microservices deployment and monitoring. The content clarified the advantages of IaC over ClickOps, how to choose suitable container runtimes, and why observability becomes essential as systems scale—laying a strong foundation for designing CI/CD pipelines and deployment environments for AI/ML and web applications.


### [Event 4](4.4-Event4/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar Workshop  

&emsp;**Time:** Saturday, November 29, 2025, 8:30 – 12:00  

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Event Summary:**  
This workshop focused on the Security Pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, covering all five domains: IAM, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, and Incident Response. The content emphasized modern IAM architecture, logging and detection-as-code, multi-layer network protection, encryption and secrets management, and structured incident response processes. The workshop reinforced the concept of “security-by-design,” the need to establish baseline security controls, and the use of automated playbooks to ensure system safety and resilience.
