### Week 8 Achievements:

- Secure Architectures: Mastered AWS multi-layer security mechanisms:
  - Identity and access management (IAM, MFA, SCP).
  - Network protection (Security Groups, NACLs, WAF, Shield).
  - Data encryption and protection (KMS, Secrets Manager).

- Resilient Architectures: Understood key strategies for building highly available and durable systems:
  - High Availability (Multi-AZ) and Global Scale (Multi-Region).
  - Disaster Recovery strategies (DR) and load balancing (ELB, Route 53).

- High-Performing Architectures: Learned how to choose optimized resources for performance:
  - Scaling mechanisms (Auto Scaling, Serverless/Lambda).
  - Storage solutions (EBS, S3, EFS) and caching/CDN (CloudFront).

- Cost-Optimized Architectures: Gained knowledge of effective cost management strategies:
  - Using monitoring tools (Cost Explorer, Budgets).
  - Data lifecycle optimization (S3 Lifecycle) and pricing models (Savings Plans).
