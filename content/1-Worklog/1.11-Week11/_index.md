### Week 11 Goals:

* **Core Feature Development:** Focus on building and refining the logic for key **Lambda Functions** related to AI (**RAG, Analyzer, Generator**).
* **Architecture Completion:** Finalize the Backend source code structure to ensure organization and scalability.
* **Optimization & Debugging:** Address performance issues typical in Serverless environments (**Timeout, Cold Start**) when integrating with LLMs.

### Tasks to be completed this week:
