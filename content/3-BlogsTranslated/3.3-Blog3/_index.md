## **AWS Classroom Training**

[AWS Classroom Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/) provides live classes with instructors who teach you in-demand cloud skills and best practices through a mix of presentations, discussions, and hands-on labs. Ask questions, explore solutions in real time, and receive feedback from [AWS-authorized instructors](https://aws.amazon.com/training/aai/?ct=sec&sec=vp) with deep subject-matter expertise.

This month, we launched the [Agentic AI Foundations](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=163859&languageId=1) course. This 1-day foundational course explores the core principles and strategies for designing Agentic AI systems using AWS services. You will learn the differences between Agentic AI and traditional conversational systems, and how to use tools such as Amazon Q, Kiro, Amazon Bedrock Agents, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build autonomous, goal-oriented solutions that solve real-world problems.
