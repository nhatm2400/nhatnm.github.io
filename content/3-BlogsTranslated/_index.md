###  [Blog 1 - Accelerating the Quantum Toolkit for Python (QuTiP) with cuQuantum on AWS](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog describes the collaborative effort between Université de Sherbrooke, NVIDIA, and AWS to accelerate quantum simulations by integrating cuQuantum into the QuTiP framework. Using the new plugin on Amazon EC2 instances powered by NVIDIA H200 GPUs, the team achieved up to a 4,000× speedup for a 64-qubit system compared to CPU-based simulations. This improvement enables deeper research into complex multi-qubit interactions needed to optimize next-generation quantum hardware. The open-source solution is now available on PyPi for the broader research community.

###  [Blog 2 - New general-purpose Amazon EC2 M8i and M8i-flex instances are now available](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog introduces the EC2 M8i and M8i-flex instances powered by Intel Xeon 6 processors, offering higher performance and better price efficiency than M7i. They deliver up to 20% more performance, 2.5× higher memory bandwidth, and notable gains for NGINX, PostgreSQL, and AI recommendation models. The 6th-generation Nitro Cards provide double the network and EBS bandwidth, along with flexible bandwidth allocation. These new instances suit general-purpose workloads and are available across multiple AWS Regions with On-Demand, Savings Plans, and Spot purchase options.

###  [Blog 3 - New courses and certification updates from AWS Training and Certification in August 2025](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog highlights new AWS training courses and certification updates for August 2025, including nine new digital courses on Skill Builder, localized exam prep content for AI Practitioner and Cloud Practitioner, and a major AWS Jam update allowing all Skill Builder Team members to create Jam events. AWS also expanded language support for foundational certification exams, introduced multilingual exam prep plans, and launched a 1-day Agentic AI Foundations course that teaches core principles for designing agentic AI systems on AWS.
